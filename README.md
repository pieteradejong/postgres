# Mastering PostgreSQL

Software Engineers have ample reason to master Postgres, both as a matter of applications, and the study of relational databases, among the most common components used in modern computer systems and applications. I asked Claude Sonnet for some short-term projec ideas.

Each of these projects will significantly deepen my understanding of PostgreSQL's internals.

# Log Analyzer
TBD. Plan to use Python or ELK stack to analyze massive amounts of log files.

# Query Planner

## Main steps:
1. Parse the input SQL query
2. Analyze the query structure
3. Generate possible execution plans
4. Estimate the cost of each plan
5. Select the plan with the lowest estimated cost
6. Output the chosen plan


## Components

Key components to implement:

- SQL Parser: Break down the SQL query into its components (SELECT, FROM, WHERE clauses, etc.)
- Plan Generator: Create possible execution strategies (e.g., table scans, index scans, joins)
- Cost Estimator: Estimate the computational cost of each operation
- Plan Optimizer: Choose the best plan based on estimated costs
- Plan Representation: A way to represent and output the chosen plan

# Connection pooler
TBD. Plan to write in C, in conjunction with [GIOS at Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6200-introduction-operating-systems) (project is in C).

# Project Ideas

1. Build a custom extension:
A PostgreSQL extension allows you to add new functionality to the database. For this project, you could:
- Create a new data type (e.g., a specialized JSON format)
- Implement custom functions or operators
- Add a new index type

This project will require you to:
- Learn C programming for PostgreSQL
- Understand PostgreSQL's extension framework
- Dive into PostgreSQL's source code
- Learn about PostgreSQL's type system and function calling conventions

2. Implement a simple query planner:
A query planner decides how to execute a given SQL query efficiently. For this project, you could:
- Parse simple SQL queries
- Generate and compare different execution plans
- Implement basic optimization techniques

This will help you understand:
- SQL parsing and abstract syntax trees
- Query optimization techniques
- PostgreSQL's cost estimation model
- How indexes and join algorithms affect query performance

3. Create a log analyzer:
PostgreSQL generates detailed logs that can be analyzed for performance tuning. In this project, you could:
- Parse PostgreSQL log files
- Extract key information like query execution times, locks, and errors
- Generate reports and visualizations

This project will teach you about:
- PostgreSQL's logging system and configuration
- Common performance issues and how to identify them
- Data analysis and visualization techniques

4. Develop a connection pooler:
A connection pooler manages a pool of connections to the database. For this project, you could:
- Implement a simple TCP server that accepts client connections
- Manage a pool of PostgreSQL connections
- Route client queries to available connections

This will help you understand:
- PostgreSQL's client-server protocol
- Connection management and pooling strategies
- Concurrency and multi-threading in database systems

5. Write a basic replication system:
Replication is crucial for high availability and disaster recovery. In this project, you could:
- Implement a simple primary-replica setup
- Parse the Write-Ahead Log (WAL)
- Transmit and apply changes to the replica

This project will give you insights into:
- PostgreSQL's Write-Ahead Logging system
- How data consistency is maintained across replicas
- Challenges in distributed database systems
